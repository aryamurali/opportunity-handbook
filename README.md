# Premise

For the past 2 years, I've been working on Opportunity Project,

* Increasing awareness about opportunities amongst engineering students
* Facilitating guidance around leveraging them
* Encouraging more students to apply to opportunities

This handbook is a compilation of advocacy, guidance and resources about discovering, validating, applying and securing opportunities from my share of learnings.

If you wish to reach me, feel free to tweet to me at **@aryacmurali** or email me at **hello@aryamurali.com.**

Do note that this is a work in progress. **Current Version:** Version 1

If you have secured any opportunity, I invite you to contribute your learnings and tips to this handbook. Check Page on '_Contribute to this Handbook_' for more.
