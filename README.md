# Premise

For the past 2 years, I've been working on Opportunity Project,

* Increasing awareness about opportunities amongst engineering students
* Facilitating guidance around leveraging them
* Encouraging more students to apply to opportunities

This handbook is a compilation of advocacy, guidance and resources about discovering, validating, applying and securing opportunities from my share of learnings.

**Current Version:** Version 1

Do note that this is a work in progress. If you have secured any opportunity, I invite you to contribute your learnings and tips to this handbook. Check Page on '_Contribute to this Handbook_' for more.
