# Best Practices on drafting your query

When you write to the organisation requesting a response to your query, these are some best practices you can follow:

### **Provide detailed information**

You may be reporting a technical issue or clarifying something. But whatever it be, ensure that you provide sufficient background for them to answer the question. In places where you can include a screenshot or the error or detail about your problem, ensure that you do it. This makes it way easier for them to evaluate your problem without the need to subsequent back and forth.

### **Give them time**

You might be in a hurry to get a response, but ensure you give them time. Typically, support email responses come with a 24 hour delay. So expect the delay and write them the query as soon as you encounter it.
