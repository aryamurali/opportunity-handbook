# Rethink’s Peer Learning Communities

**Rethink’s Peer Learning Communities**

We have learning communities where applicants of a specific opportunity can interact amongst each other and also clarify their queries. These communities are on telegram and work really well in providing peer support while applying to these opportunities.

v@r is your window to reach us safely and personally. If you feel you have unanswered queries about opportunities after following all the above steps, feel free to write in to [volunteers@rethinkfoundartion.in](mailto:volunteers@rethinkfoundartion.in) and we shall facilitate guidance as best as possible.

Do note that we are not the official authority offering the scholarship and so can only provide guidance on how you can go about your queries. They are not to be seen as full and final or as an official response.
