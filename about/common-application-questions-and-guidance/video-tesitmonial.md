# Video Testimonial

Most applications have a particular topic upon which you will have to create your video. It could be about. The topics may be quite similar to the essay questions also.

What you’d be expected to do is shoot a video on the topic, detailing all the points you are expected to be speaking on, upload the video to a popular video sharing website and then share the link in the application form.

Since the word limit in some applications may be stringent, you have only so much space to express your ideas and experiences fully. This is where the video might come in handy. You can really make use of your time in front of the camera to share a personal story that will add in more credibility to your application.

## Best Practices

**Be natural**

It is a good idea to always be your natural self. Speak as if you are having a comfortable conversation with the reviewers but don’t be too lousy either. Stick to the point and be original.

**Stick to the time limit**

In most cases, you will be asked to restrict your video within a particular time limit. Sticking to this guideline is a good practice. The reviewers will be taking a look at multiple videos and they’d have only so much time to watch through your video. So having a super long video explaining everything might bore them and increase chances of them breaking out of the thread as well.

**Be confident**

If you don’t believe in what you are saying, chances are that the reviewers will also not believe in you. So no matter what you are saying, say it with confidence, Say it with conviction.

**Don’t mind your language proficiency**

Remember, the purpose of the video is to get to know you and your persona slightly better. It is not to check on how eloquently you can speak. So there’s no need to bother much about your language proficiency and how well an orator you are.

**Be clearly visible and audible**

Ensure that the audio and visuals of your video are clean. If the reviewer cannot see or hear your properly, it is going to keep bothering them as they watch the video.
