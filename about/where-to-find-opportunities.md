# Where to find opportunities?

These days, you can find opportunities everywhere. From the newspaper, from your peers and also from the internet. Most education supplements with newspapers have a section on opportunities.

However, your best chances of finding opportunities is:

1. By searching on the internet
2. Through your professional network

There are also some specific websites also that list opportunities. List below summarises few of them:

1. [Hey Success](https://www.heysuccess.com/)

   Hey success lists internship, scholarships, competitions and other such opportunities. The only drawback of heysuccess is that it allows you to view names of only 40 opportunities for free.

2. [Pro**F**ellow](https://www.profellow.com/sign-up/)

   ProFellow is a site for fellowships. They permit you to access opportunities for free. Fully funded higher education fellowships and opportunities seem to cover the majority of the database.

3. [Buddy for Study](http://www.buddy4study.com/)

   Buddy4study is primarily focussed on scholarships. Their portal is free to access and lists a good amount of quality scholarships.

To make things easier, Rethink also has two key means of discovering these opportunities.  


1. [Rethink Wiki](https://wiki.rethinkfoundation.in/Opportunities)

   Rethink wiki is our curated list of opportunities. We donâ€™t put in an opportunity in our wiki unless we confirm its validity.

2. [Rethink Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RethinkCollect)

   Our reddit is an open notice board. People who encounter new opportunities post them on to our reddit board. While this is a great way of discovering new opportunities, do note that these opportunities have not been validated by us.
