## Guidance for GSoC and other Open source programs

**Google Summer of Code(GSoC)** is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open 
source organisation and during the end of our period Google will pay you an handsome stipend for your contribution if you
have passed all evaluation criterias.

GSoC 2019 has just begun with about 207 organisations this time. Do checkout the organisations [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/).
Also keep a close attention to the timeline mentioned [here](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline).

There are a lot of resources already in Internet on how to crack GSoC. We will be pointing to some of the amazing resources
