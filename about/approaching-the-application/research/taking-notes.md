# Taking Notes

As you find more information and validate them, it may be good for you to consolidate all your learning into a document or notebook. The primary idea is to have your conclusions written down.

As you write the application form, you will very much need to refer these notes from your research and incorporate elements from it in your application responses as well.

So do note to either bookmark or save the links to relevant information online so that you can go back and refer to it if needed.
