# Rethink’s Wikipedia of Opportunities

Researching about something and validating it can be a time consuming process. But despite that, it is a high value work and will really do you good.

But to make it easier for you to do this, we have our wiki. We validate all the opportunities we discover and add them in to our wiki. We also have basic information about the opportunity, the organisation listed in the wiki page for the respective opportunity.

In cases where we have been able to locate previous winners and interview them, the information has also been made available.

To find our wiki, you can **google for “Rethink Wiki”** and I’m sure one of the first links to come up will be ours.
